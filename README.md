Note
===========
Should be the last version of Depan when the repo was deleted. But I'm not 100% sure if the binary version matches the current source code.

Description
===========

Tools for estimation and compensation of global motion (pan).

Requires libfftw3f-3.dll to be in the search path. http://www.fftw.org/install/windows.html

Ported from AviSynth plugin http://avisynth.org.ru/


Usage
=====

    depan.DePanEstimate(clip clip[, int range=0, float trust=4.0, int winx, int winy, int wleft=-1, int wtop=-1, int dxmax=winx/4, int dymax=winy/4, float zoommax=1.0, float stab=1.0, float pixaspect=1.0])

* range: Number of previous (and also next) frames (fields) near requested frame to estimate motion.

* trust: Limit of relative maximum correlation difference from mean value at scene change. (0.0 to 100.0)

* winx: Number of columns (width) of fft window. (default to the maximum power of 2 within frame width)

* winy: Number of rows (height) of fft window. (default to the maximum power of 2 within frame height)

* wleft: Left position (offset) of fft window. (-1 for auto centered window)

* wtop: Top position (offset) of fft window. (-1 for auto centered window)

* dxmax: Limit of x shift.

* dymax: Limit of y shift.

* zoommax: Maximum zoom factor. (if =1, zoom is not estimated)

* stab: Decreasing of calculated trust for large shifts.
  * 0.0 = not decrease
  * 1.0 = half at dxmax, dymax

* pixaspect: Pixel aspect.

---

    depan.DePan(clip clip, clip data[, float offset=0.0, float pixaspect=1.0, bint matchfields=True, int mirror=0, int blur=0, int[] planes])

* data: Service clip with coded motion data, produced by `depan.DePanEstimate`.

* offset: Value of compensation offset for all input frames (fields). (-10.0 to 10.0)
  * 0.0 = null transform
  * -1.0 = full backward motion compensation of next frame (field) to current
  * 1.0 = full forward motion compensation of previous frame (field)
  * -0.5 = backward semi-compensation of next frame (field)
  * 0.5 = forward semi-compensation of previous frame (field)
  * 0.3333333 = forward one-third compensation of previous frame (field)
  * -1.5 = backward semi-compensation of next next frame (field)
  * 2.0 = full forward motion compensation of previous previous frame (field)
  * and so on

* pixaspect: Pixel aspect.

* matchfields: Match vertical position of interlaced fields for preserve fields order, better denoising etc.

* mirror: Fill empty borders with mirrored from frame edge pixels (instead of black).
  * 0 = no mirror
  * 1 = top
  * 2 = bottom
  * 4 = left
  * 8 = right
  * sum any of above combination (15 = all)

* blur: Blur mirrored zone by using given max blur length (0 is no blur, the good value is above 30)

* planes: A list of the planes to process. By default all planes are processed.
